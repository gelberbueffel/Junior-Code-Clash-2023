            <titleArticle>Why is Recycling a first step to save nature?</titleArticle>
            <p>There are many ways to protect the environment, one simple yet very effective way is recycling.
            It may seem very minor and has now become an integral part of most households, but it still deserves a great deal of attention.
            Recycling starts with the correct separation of waste.
            Plastic waste is disposed of in the "yellow bag", waste paper in the green (sometimes also blue) garbage can and residual waste in the black garbage can.<br>
            One difference to this recycling system is direct recycling, where all materials that can be recycled are collected in a container and then picked up by a recycling service.<br>
            Although this makes the recycling process easier for the consumer, it can also slow down the whole process as the materials have to be sorted first.<br><br></p>

            <smallTitle>Precious metal as hidden treasure</smallTitle><br><br>
            <p>Hazardous waste such as electronic waste or large quantities of waste should ideally be taken directly to a landfill site, as the staff there are specialists who are best informed about the components.<br>
            The correct disposal of electrical waste is particularly important, as technical devices contain many valuable precious metals, including gold, copper and tantalum.<br>
            Precious metals are limited resources and are unfortunately usually mined under undignified conditions. People in developing countries in particular are forced to work, even children have to work several hours a day without protective clothing, resulting in thousands of deaths every year.<br>
            It is therefore all the more important to recycle these metals. Another option is to process the material yourself, which does not even require much prior knowledge. You can find many tutorials on the Internet, including a homemade clock made from old electrical parts.<br><br></p>
            <smallTitle>Getting creative while saving the environment</smallTitle><br><br>
            <p>Using old material to make new things is called upcycling, and any material can be used to make clothes or bags from old fabric, for example. Even inconspicuous waste can have special properties, for example by serving as insulation or being water-repellent.<br>
            There are no limits to creativity and you can also help the environment in the process.<br>
            But even if you don't have a knack for crafts yourself, there are many groups and associations that practice upcycling as a hobby and are happy to receive donations of materials. <br>
            Overall, recycling has already become an integral part of our lives, but in some countries it should be better enshrined in law. Upcycling has found a creative and sensible way to reuse materials and protect nature at the same time.<br><br></p>
