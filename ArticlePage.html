            <titleArticle>How does the climate change influence our lives?</titleArticle>
            <p>Climate change is now one of the most topical and important issues facing our society. An understanding of it emerged shortly after industrialization and has attracted increasing attention. In Germany, as in other parts of the world, people are turning to the government because they believe that politicians are not yet doing enough to stop climate change.<br>
            But what impact does climate change have on our lives? How can we assess the current situation and why is the issue so important?<br><br></p>

            <p> most noticeable change as a result of climate change is the increased rise in temperature. In recent years, the average annual temperature has risen sharply; records have shown that annual temperatures have risen by more than 1 degree Celsius since the 19th century. In principle, this may sound like very little, but the effects are clearer than ever before:<br>
            Heatwaves are occurring more frequently and warm temperature periods are extending further throughout the year. In mild to colder climate zones, the consequences are noticeable and also cause damage, but in hot climate zones such as Australia, there are often severe bushfires that endanger both the inhabitants and the animals.<br><br></p>

                <smallTitle>Rising waterlevels</smallTitle><br><br>
            <p>Rising temperatures are also causing the ice in the Arctic and Antarctic to melt. This is destroying the natural habitat of the animals living there, which in turn increases the risk of extinction. The enormous masses of water created by the melting ice are causing sea levels to rise. This primarily affects island areas and land areas that lie below sea level.<br> 
            The risk of flooding now becomes apparent in the fall and winter, as the rising storm surges cause more and more damage. The North and East Frisian Islands are almost completely flooded, and the northern cities in the Netherlands and Germany also have to contend with the problems every year.<br>
            These conditions are exacerbated by the fact that, as a result of climate change, storms and rainfall are becoming more severe and can also cause damage in the midlands.<br><br><br>
